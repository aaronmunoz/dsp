# Learn command line

Please follow and complete the free online [Bash Scripting Tutorial](https://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/) or [Codecademy's Learn the Command Line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line). These are helpful tutorials. You should be able to go through these in a couple of hours.

**Note:** Bash is not installed on a PC. Rather, PC users must install Cygwin. Once Cygwin has been installed, the command line interface witll _emulate_ bash. You can find all information regarding Cygwin [here](https://www.cygwin.com/).

### Q1.  Cheat Sheet of Commands  

Here's a list of items with which you should be familiar:  
* show current working directory path
* creating a directory
* deleting a directory
* creating a file using `touch` command
* deleting a file
* renaming a file
* listing hidden files
* copying a file from one directory to another

Make a cheat sheet for yourself: a list of at least **ten** commands and what they do.  (Use the 8 items above and add a couple of your own.)  

> > Command | Description
> > ------- | -----------
> > pwd | Shows currently working directory path
> > mkdir | Creates a directory
> > rm | Removes a directory. The '-r' parameter deleters all children as well
> > touch new_file_name.txt | Creates a file named 'new_file_name.txt'
> > rm file_name | Deletes 'file_name'
> > mv original_file_name new_file_name | Renames 'original_file_name' to 'new_file_name'
> > ls -a | Lists all files in the directory, including hidden files
> > mv my_file new_directory | Moves a file named 'my_file' to the directory 'new_directory'
> > ditto -V /old_directory/ /new_directory/ | Copies content from 'old_directory' into 'new_directory' while listing the progress in the terminal
> > tab | Not exactly a command, but useful to know for autocompleting paths

### Q4.  Xargs   

What does `xargs` do? Give an example of how to use it.

> > xargs allows you to execute commands from standard input. xargs is particularly useful in combination with the find command. For example, `find *rough_draft* | xargs rm` would remove all files in a directory containing the string 'rough_draft'.
